- you can send requests to /blog/posts/post_pk/comments/
even if post_pk does not exist

- if you open home with expired token it throws 401 and does not get a new token (it never gets solved)
I should make a request util and use that for every request. If the request returns a 401, log user out.

- text overflows editor
