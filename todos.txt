- User tab on header
- Render header content conditionally
- New Post page
- Edit Post page
- Send number of comments and if user has bookmarked in post view
- Finish post previews (icons, title)
- Add handlers to send like and bookmark requests
- Add comment form
- Make image optional, if not image, the preview is just the rest (it's smaller)
- User page
- Tags
- Make list and detail serializers separate, specially for posts. (!)
- Make request util (try/catch). Check firebase's video short on that
- Comments likes are not working (deleting them)
- Commenting should update state
- Put post owner actions inside a menu (3 dots), same with delete/edit comment.
- Editing posts (submiting) doesn't work. Error in request content-type.
- order bookmarks from date bookmarked
- User description shouldn't have a default on the backend. If not description, put a default on the frontend.
- Add filtering and ordering at the same time
- Add error pages (error elements on App.js)
- If request fails because of token, redirect to login
- Margin between post img, title and tags is not good on phones (post preview)

- Responsive design

- Add margin variables
- Add like, save button, and small author under image/title to post detail
- The side bar should be toggleable everywhere on the site (CHECK DEV.TO)
THE OVERLAY SHOULD BE ON ROOT AND BE UNIQUE (it can be used by every component (maybe future modals))

- Make images preserve ratio (CHECK DEV.TO)
- When no search found or no posts saved, etc, put a fallback like "no posts found, try something different"
- Add show more to wall comments? (only for phones)
- Solve Read Later page margins. Add the margin variables.

- Pagination

- When editing or creating a post, if I leave without saving, the images uploaded to the server should be deleted. Same when editing user
- APPLY REST PRACTICES
- /api lists endpoints
- Make code dry. Among much other stuff, the code for the profile picture image borders on the frontend is repeated various times.
